## 🎯 Professional Focus

I am developing hands-on IT expertise through a deliberate, phase-based lab progression designed to mirror real-world IT environments.

Rather than skipping ahead to advanced tooling, I am building strong operational foundations first — starting with Help Desk workflows, system troubleshooting, and user support — before advancing into networking, infrastructure, and security engineering.

My long-term objective is to design and operate a fully simulated enterprise security environment: the **Department of Pasco Security (DPS) Lab**.

## 🛠 Technical Environment

Primary System:
- Apple M2 MacBook Air (16GB RAM)

Virtualization Stack:
- VMware Fusion
- Windows 11 ARM
- Windows Server
- Ubuntu Server (planned integration)

External Storage:
- 2TB Lab Backup Drive

## 🔧 Current Phase: Help Desk Operations Lab

I am actively building and documenting practical IT support skills including:

- Windows 11 configuration and system recovery
- User account provisioning and access control
- Software deployment and removal
- Network connectivity diagnostics (ipconfig, ping, tracert)
- Peripheral troubleshooting (printers, devices)
- Structured ticket documentation and resolution workflows
- Active Directory user support scenarios

### Lab Environment
- Windows 11 Client (VM)
- Windows Server Domain Controller
- Simulated end-user issues
- Step-by-step troubleshooting documentation
- Root cause analysis notes

Objective: Develop strong troubleshooting instincts, structured thinking, and professional documentation habits — the core competencies of effective IT professionals.

- DNS and DHCP configuration
- Packet capture and traffic analysis
- Core routing and firewall concepts

---

### 🖥 Active Directory Infrastructure Lab
- Organizational Unit design
- Group Policy implementation
- Permission structuring
- Domain authentication flow analysis

---

### 🗄 IT Asset & Ticketing Database (MySQL)
- Relational schema design

## 🏗 Long-Term Vision: Department of Pasco Security (DPS)

The DPS Lab will evolve in three phases:

Phase 1 – Operational Foundations  
Help Desk systems, networking fundamentals, Active Directory, Linux services  

Phase 2 – Infrastructure Engineering  
Network segmentation, centralized logging, firewall architecture, database-backed systems  

Phase 3 – Security Operations  
SOC simulation, incident response workflows, threat detection, cloud integration  

This GitHub serves as a documented progression toward that enterprise-level objective.
